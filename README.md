## Data Scientist & AI ##

One of my strengths is my diverse background, which allows me to tackle tasks in various fields such as manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. I've worked on a wide range of data domains, providing a solid foundation for my capabilities.

I embarked on my career as an AI researcher by performing a 2D Image-Classification Task based on secondary battery technology, specifically focusing on identifying defects in high-precision electric vehicle batteries. I made use of pre-trained models and optimization techniques to start my career in this field.

Subsequently, I worked as a big data analyst and engineer in the finance AI division at NCSOFT. Initially, I classified various asset classes and built technical indicators to establish risk-diversified asset portfolios. Eventually, I developed a global stock trading market analysis module based on Multi-Factor and tick data, integrating it with an RDBMS. During the process of transitioning to a distributed processing framework, I achieved a more than 60-fold improvement in time efficiency and successfully deployed it as an operational module.

Currently, I am affiliated with the Seoul National University Hospital's Department of Radiology AI research group. I am actively involved in developing technology using MR-based 3D image deep learning models to accurately diagnose tumors and edema in patients with chondrosarcoma. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to improving patient survival rates through this technology.

## Introduce

Hello, my name is Min Soo Kim.


One of my strengths is that I have worked with diverse data domains in various fields. I conducted a ```2D Image-Classification Task``` on electric vehicle batteries, focusing on *"High-Precision Electric Vehicle Battery Defect Classification."* I utilized and optimized pre-trained models in the Tensorflow framework for this task.


Subsequently, I worked as a ```Data Analystic Engineer``` in the **NCSoft Financial AI department**, where I primarily handled big data design tasks. I classified various asset classes for algorithmic stock trading and built technical indicators. 


In the end, I designed a pipeline for analyzing the structure of the domestic ```KOSPI 200``` and ```KOSDAQ 150```stock markets based on ```tick data``` and related databases. During the process of transitioning to a distributed processing framework within the Apache Zeppelin environment in Python, 

*"I achieved more than a 60-fold improvement in time efficiency and successfully migrated it to the production environment."*


Currently, I am working as a ```AI researcher``` in the **Department of Radiology at Seoul National University Hospital**. I am conducting research on improving the performance of a 3D CNN deep learning model for patient prognosis prediction based on ```3D MRI brain image``` and exploring ways to expand it to multi-modal data. 


Also I contributed as a ```co-author``` to an SCIE paper on a study investigating whether the thickness of the frontal lobe interacts with age to be a significant prognostic indicator for oligodendroglioma patients and played a role in drafting the initial version of the paper.

**Statistics (SNUH)**

I participated as a co-author in <a href="https://github.com/immsk1997/mskim/blob/main/SNUH%20Medical%20AI/Research/Statistics/ASNR%20Abstract.pdf">**the gbm survival prediction project**</a>, led by Professor Choi Kyu Sung at Seoul National University Hospital, under the guidance of the first author, Professor Lee Kyung Hoon at Soonchunhyang University Hospital. However, the project was recently rejected by the 2024 ASNR (American Society of Neuroradiology) journal.

## Introduce
One of my strengths is that I have worked with diverse data domains in various fields. I conducted a ```2D Image-Classification Task``` on electric vehicle batteries, focusing on *"High-Precision Electric Vehicle Battery Defect Classification."* I utilized and optimized pre-trained models in the Tensorflow framework for this task.


Subsequently, I worked as a ```Data Analystic Engineer``` in the **NCSoft Financial AI department**, where I primarily handled big data design tasks. I classified various asset classes for algorithmic stock trading and built technical indicators. 


In the end, I designed a pipeline for analyzing the structure of the domestic ```KOSPI 200``` and ```KOSDAQ 150```stock markets based on ```tick data``` and related databases. During the process of transitioning to a distributed processing framework within the Apache Zeppelin environment in Python, 

*"I achieved more than a 60-fold improvement in time efficiency and successfully migrated it to the production environment."*


Currently, I am working as a ```AI researcher``` in the **AICON, Department of Radiology at Seoul National University Hospital**. I am conducting research on improving the performance of a 3D CNN deep learning model for patient prognosis prediction based on ```3D MRI brain image``` and exploring ways to expand it to multi-modal data.
